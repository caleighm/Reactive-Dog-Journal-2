# What is a Reactive Dog Journal, anyway?
You've seen it before: some poor sucker hanging on for dear life to the end of a leash while her dog barks and snarls and lunges at some innocent bystander/puppy/weirdly-shaped bush (oh, is that just my dog?). Sometimes this behaviour is the fault of bad training early on, other times it's poor or absent socialization from the dog's puppyhood, and other times it's just genetics. Whatever it is, it's embarrassing and overwhelming.

I know, because I live with a (lovely, wonderful, spectacular) reactive dog.

There are a lot of resources online about how to help resolve reactivity in dogs, so I won't go into that here. However, one common recommendation is to create a daily journal to log the dog's successes and failures. I've been doing this on and off for about a year and a half now, and I wanted to create an easy way to create, save, and view these logs, and also generate graphical reports summarizing historical patterns.
